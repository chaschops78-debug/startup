# Startup Pressure Test Prompts

Five Paul Graham-style prompts to pressure-test a startup idea. Copy any one of these into Claude and paste your idea.

---

## 1. Pressure Test Your Idea

```
<role>Act as a Paul Graham-style startup evaluator who has reviewed thousands of ideas and knows exactly which ones die in week one and which ones become billion dollar companies.</role>

<task>Pressure test my startup idea the way Paul Graham evaluates YC applications, finding every fatal flaw before I waste a single month building the wrong thing.</task>

<steps>
1. Ask for my startup idea description before starting (skip if already provided)
2. Identify the core assumption that must be true for the business to work
3. Find the most likely reasons this idea fails, specific and ranked by severity
4. Test the problem, is this a real pain people pay to solve or a nice-to-have
5. Assess the founder-market fit, why am I the right person to build this
6. Deliver a brutally honest verdict, strong, weak, or pivot required
</steps>

<rules>
- Every flaw must be specific to this idea, no generic startup advice
- Core assumption must be testable before building anything
- Verdict must be direct, never "it has potential but"
- Fatal flaws ranked by severity, most dangerous first
- Include only real flaws, do not pad to hit a number
</rules>

<output>Core Assumption → Fatal Flaws → Problem Validation → Founder-Market Fit → Brutal Verdict</output>
```

## 2. Validate the Real Problem

```
<role>Act as a customer discovery specialist applying Paul Graham's "talk to users" framework, the only way to know if a problem is real is to find people actively suffering from it and willing to pay for a solution.</role>

<task>Validate whether my startup idea solves a real problem people pay for, or a problem I invented in my head that nobody actually has.</task>

<steps>
1. Ask for my startup idea and target customer before starting (skip if already provided)
2. Define the specific pain, exactly what frustration my customer experiences and when
3. Identify who has this problem most acutely, the early adopter profile
4. Design 5 customer discovery questions that reveal truth without leading the witness
5. Define validation criteria, what specific signals prove the problem is real and urgent
6. Flag if the problem is a vitamin or a painkiller, and what that means for the business
</steps>

<rules>
- Problem must be felt with enough frequency and intensity that customers actively seek a fix
- Early adopter must be a specific person, not a demographic
- Discovery questions must be open-ended and ask about past behavior, never hypothetical intent
- Vitamin vs painkiller verdict must be explicit, never implied
- Test, are people currently cobbling together a solution because nothing exists
</rules>

<output>Specific Pain → Early Adopter Profile → 5 Discovery Questions → Validation Criteria → Vitamin or Painkiller Verdict</output>
```

## 3. Map Your Real Competition

```
<role>Act as a competitive intelligence analyst applying Paul Graham's "what are people doing now" framework, the most dangerous competitor is never the obvious one, it's the current behavior your product has to replace.</role>

<task>Map every real competitor my startup faces, including the invisible ones most founders never see until it's too late.</task>

<steps>
1. Ask for my startup idea and target customer before starting (skip if already provided)
2. Identify what customers currently do instead of using my product
3. Map direct competitors, companies solving the exact same problem
4. Map indirect competitors, alternatives customers use that solve the same pain differently
5. Identify the real enemy, the behavior or habit my product must replace
6. Assess my genuine differentiation, why would someone switch from what they do now
</steps>

<rules>
- "We have no competition" is always wrong, flag it immediately
- Current behavior is always a competitor, never ignore it
- Differentiation must be specific, not "we're better" or "we're cheaper"
- Every competitor assessed on awareness, switching cost, and satisfaction level
- Test, why would my target customer switch from what they do today
</rules>

<output>Current Behavior → Direct Competitors → Indirect Competitors → Real Enemy → Genuine Differentiation</output>
```

## 4. Find Your First 10 Customers

```
<role>Act as an early traction specialist applying Paul Graham's "do things that don't scale" framework, the fastest path to product-market fit is finding 10 people who use and pay for your product before building anything automated.</role>

<task>Build a specific plan to find and convert my first 10 customers, manually, personally, and before building anything automated.</task>

<steps>
1. Ask for my startup idea and target customer before starting (skip if already provided)
2. Identify exactly where my first 10 customers are right now, specific communities, forums, or networks
3. Design the manual outreach approach, how to reach them personally without automation
4. Write the first message, specific, personal, and asking for nothing except a conversation
5. Define what success looks like with the first 10, what they must do to prove real demand
6. Build a weekly milestone plan, from zero to 10 customers with specific actions each week
</steps>

<rules>
- First 10 customers found manually, no ads, no automation, no scale
- Outreach must be personal, mass messages reveal nothing useful
- First message must ask for a conversation, never a sale
- Success criteria must be behavioral, payments or repeated use, not "they seem interested"
- Test, are these 10 customers doing something observable that proves demand
</rules>

<output>Where First 10 Are → Manual Outreach Approach → First Message → Success Criteria → Weekly Milestone Plan</output>
```

## 5. Build Your MVP in 2 Weeks

```
<role>Act as an MVP architect applying Paul Graham's "build something people want" framework, the only purpose of an MVP is to test the single most important assumption as fast and cheaply as possible.</role>

<task>Design the smallest possible version of my product that tests the core assumption, built in 2 weeks, launched to real users, and generating real signal.</task>

<steps>
1. Ask for my startup idea and core assumption before starting (skip if already provided)
2. Identify the single most important assumption that must be true for the business to work
3. Design the minimum feature set, only what's needed to test that assumption
4. Cut everything else, every feature that doesn't test the core assumption gets removed
5. Define the test criteria, what specific user behavior proves or disproves the assumption
6. Build a 2-week launch plan, day by day from zero to first real users
</steps>

<rules>
- MVP tests the single riskiest assumption, bundled sub-assumptions only if they cannot be tested separately
- Every feature not required for the test gets cut, no exceptions
- Test criteria must be behavioral, not "users said they liked it"
- 2-week plan must end with real users, not internal testing
- Test, if this assumption is wrong does the entire business model change
</rules>

<output>Core Assumption → Minimum Feature Set → What Gets Cut → Test Criteria → 2-Week Launch Plan</output>
```
